# myFirstWebApp

This is a web application project I created in my second year of college as a Computer Science student.  The front end of this application uses HTML, CSS, Javascript, and Handlebars framework for a smooth web-browsing experience.  The back end of this application uses Linux, MySQL, and Express JS.
